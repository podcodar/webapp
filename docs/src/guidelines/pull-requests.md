# Pull Requests

Pull requests are a critical part of the development process. They provide a way for team members to review and discuss changes before they are merged into the main branch. This helps ensure that the code is of high quality, maintainable, and follows the coding standards.

## Process

1. **Create a Pull Request** - When you are ready to have your code reviewed, create a pull request. Make sure to include a description of the changes and any relevant information that the reviewer should know.
2. **Assign it to yourself** - Assign the pull request to yourself, so that you can review it before assigning it to others.
3. **Assign Reviewers** - Assign at least one reviewer to the pull request. This person should be someone who is familiar with the codebase and can provide valuable feedback.
4. **Communicate** - Send a message to our Teams channel with the link to the pull request, so that other team members can review it.

## Review

Check the [Code Reviews](code-review.md) document for more information on how to review pull requests.

## Best Practices

- **Describe your work** - Provide a clear description of the changes in the pull request. Explain what the changes are, why they were made, and how they affect the codebase.
- **Keep it small** - Keep your pull requests small and focused. This makes them easier to review and ensures that each change is well-tested and understood.
- **Test your changes** - Make sure that your changes work as expected and don't introduce any regressions. Write tests for your code to ensure that it works as intended.
- **Follow the coding standards** - Make sure that your code follows the coding standards and best practices outlined in the [Coding Standards](coding-standards.md) and [git-workflow](git-workflow.md) documents.
- **Be open to feedback** - Be open to receiving feedback on your code and be willing to make changes based on that feedback. Remember that code reviews are a collaborative process.
